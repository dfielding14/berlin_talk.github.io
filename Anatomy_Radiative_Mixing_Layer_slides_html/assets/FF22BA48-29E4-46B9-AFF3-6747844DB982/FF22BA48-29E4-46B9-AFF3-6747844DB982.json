Possibly the density profile adjusts where it crosses the velocity profile to satisfy the KE budget, but I think cooling will always want the hot cold transition as close to the leading edge as possible, so this imbalance may lead to the fluctuations in the hot-cold interface and explain why A\/L^2 ~ (vrel tcool)^(1\/4)","targetRectangle":{"y":178.03340148925781,"x":54.66668701171875,"width":1816.0960000000005,"height":264}},{"text":"3 Oct 2019","targetRectangle":{"y":1037.1666261553764,"x":1756.1060380935669,"width":123.52800000000002,"height":33}},{"text":"Drummond Fielding","targetRectangle":{"y":1037.1666261553764,"x":40.866021156311035,"width":223.34400000000005,"height":33}},{"text":"Turbulence and the kinetic energy budget","targetRectangle":{"y":15.666666984558105,"x":40.1041259765625,"width":1773.3119999999997,"height":131}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.00035007912466775983,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"DFB60D30AE1C1EB81A2B09603D6600F8"}]}]}}]}
